# Minecraft-Server.eu Voting Bot

A voting bot for Minecraft-Server.eu. Supports proxies and multiple servers and usernames to vote for.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pip
- Pipenv (`pip install pipenv`)
- Mozilla Firefox

## Important

- Minecraft-Server.eu does IP ban after around 4-5 votes (not exactly sure) so it's advised to use proxies (that are not banned by Google)

## TODO

- Integrate Captcha Solving API from Antigate
- 2 Modes:
  - Botting only votes
  - Botting rewards (typing usernames in)
- Implement a proxy scraper
- Ip ban check
- Document the installation process
